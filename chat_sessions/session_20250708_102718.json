      "content": "The case involves Petitioner Central Coalfields Ltd. and Respondent Ekate of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. The appeal arises from the order of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dated May 3, 1985, made in Misc. Pet. No. 1260/82.\n\nThe Petitioner, Central Coalfields Ltd., challenged the directions dated May 4, 1981, order dated September 30, 1981, and a further order dated June 9, 1982, passed by the second respondent, Chairman of Special Areas Development Authority (SADA), Singrauli, in the District of Sidhi of M.P., directing the Petitioner under Section 26 of the M.P. Land Acquisition Act, 1950.\n\nThe Petitioner contended that the directions were violative of the principles of natural justice and that the Respondent had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act. The Petitioner also contended that the Respondent had not considered the objections raised by the Petitioner and had not given a reasonable opportunity to the Petitioner to present its case.\n\nThe Supreme Court allowed the amendment of the cause title and dismissed the intervention application. The Court also allowed the appeal and set aside the directions passed by the Respondent. The Court held that the Respondent had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act and had not given a reasonable opportunity to the Petitioner to present its case. The Court also held that the directions were violative of the principles of natural justice.\n\nIn summary, the case involves a dispute between the Petitioner, Central Coalfields Ltd., and the Respondent, Ekate of Madhya Pradesh & Ors., regarding the acquisition of land under the M.P. Land Acquisition Act, 1950. The Petitioner challenged the directions passed by the Respondent, which were held to be violative of the principles of natural justice and the procedure prescribed under the Act."
